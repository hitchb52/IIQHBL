  This is used by 'iiq upgrade' to drive upgrading the schema and data between revisions. There are two files that
  define the upgrade: upgrade.xml and upgradeObjects.xml. If you have IdentityAI enabled, there are an additional two
  files, upgrade-ai.xml and upgradeObjects-ai.xml.
  upgrade.xml and upgrade-ai.xml are processed in a special way before Hibernate is started so that changes can be made
  at the JDBC level. These files should only contain <ImportAction> elements that use the "execute" command to call
  upgrader classes.
  *DO NOT PUT STATIC XML OBJECTS IN UPGRADE.XML OR UPGRADE-AI.XML*
  upgradeObjects-ai.xml is included by upgrade-ai.xml and will be imported after Hibernate is started. Any changes to
  objects that can be represented as static XML or as ImportActions with the "merge" command must go in these files to
  ensure that they are parsed after Hibernate has been started so that references can be resolved.
