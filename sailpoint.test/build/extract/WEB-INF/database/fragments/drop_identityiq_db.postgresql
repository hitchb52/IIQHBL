-- In order to drop the identityiq database, Postgres requires a connection to a database other than the one being dropped.

-- You must switch here to a different non-SailPoint database connection while dropping the
-- SailPoint databases. If postgres/postgres isn't available, change the line below to a
-- different available connection.

\connect postgres postgres;
ALTER DATABASE identityiq OWNER TO postgres;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS identityiq;
DROP USER IF EXISTS identityiq;
